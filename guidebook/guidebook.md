  * what format are the messages (e.g. plain text, Avro, JSON)?
  * are they synchronous or asynchronous?
  * are asynchronous messaging links guaranteed?
  * are subscribers durable where necessary?
  * can messages be received out of order and is this a problem?
  * are interfaces idempotent?
  * is the interface always available or do you need the cache data locally?
  * how is performance/security/etc catered for?
1. Has each interface been thought about from a non-technical perspective?
  * who has ownership of the interface?
